    <h1>Greetings!</h1>
    <p>The page you are viewing right now showcases the efforts of making it to the 4-week mark for CIT-82. 
        To showcase this progress, I will be discussing a bit about myself in a little more detail. 
        Hopefully what you see here is a solid represention of how much I've learned.</p>
        <h2>My Academic Path Thus Far</h2>
        <p>I originally took courses at Fresno City College to become a social worker.
            However, I decided to check out Computer Inforamtion Tech courses instead due to how emotionally
            draining being a social worker can be at times. At this point, I have a few Computer Inforamtion Tech
            Courses under my belt so far. And I hope that whatever I learn from any more can help me figure out where
            I want to go in the Computer Information Tech field.
        </p>
        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I have a few hobbies that help me relax whenever I need to have a mental break from work. The following list
            contains the activities I usually do to relax:
            <ol>
                <li>Play Video Games</li>
                <li>Listen to Music</li>
                <li>Walk around the Inside of My House</li>
                <li>Browse Online Stores</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>How do these activities normally go?</h3>
            Most of the Music I generally listen to is from Video Games (simply because video game music is varied and 
            can be quite catchy at times). The Video Game systems I normally use are a Gaming PC and a Nintendo Switch, mainly
            playing Role-Playing Games or other Action Games that interest me. On the topic of walking around the inside of my house, I mainly
            do so to help me stay active and get my brain to think with imagination in case I get bored of playing games. The online store services I usually
            browse are Amazon and Ebay most of the time, though I make sure not to immediately spend money on something, which helps with not losing money.</p>
            <h3>Can you give examples of what games you play?</h3>
            <p>Of course I can. As stated earlier, I mainly play Role-Playing Games (RPGs for simple naming) and other Action Games. Hack and Slash games always piqued my interested, and one
                style of Hack n' Slash Games that I've started playing a little more are Monster Hunting Games. In those games, your basic objective is to hunt dangerous monsters for parts,
                usually resulting in acquiring materials that strengthen your tools to hunt even more dangerous monsters. This style of gameplay was brought up by a game series called Monster
                Hunter, which was developed by Capcom. Below is some artwork on an Upcoming Monster Hunter game called Monster Hunter: Rise, which will be out on the Nintendo Switch later in March.
