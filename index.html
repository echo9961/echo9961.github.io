    <h1>Greetings!</h1>
    <p>The page you are viewing right now showcases the efforts of making it to the 4-week mark for CIT-82. 
        To showcase this progress, I will be discussing a bit about myself in a little more detail. 
        Hopefully what you see here is a solid represention of how much I've learned.</p>
        <h2>My Academic Path Thus Far</h2>
        <p>I originally took courses at Fresno City College to become a social worker.
            However, I decided to check out Computer Inforamtion Tech courses instead due to how emotionally
            draining being a social worker can be at times. At this point, I have a few Computer Inforamtion Tech
            Courses under my belt so far. And I hope that whatever I learn from any more can help me figure out where
            I want to go in the Computer Information Tech field.
        </p>
