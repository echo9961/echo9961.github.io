<h1>Greetings!</h1>

<p>What you see here is my first HTML page from my new repository.<br>
Since I'm new to Web Development, there is still much to learn and experience with this course.<br>
My main goal for this course is to see what path I would like to take in Computer Information Tech<br>
based on what is learned from this course.</p>

<p>I wish you all a bright future!</p>
